Hello, I'm Dr. Joshua Vaughan. I'm currently the Group Leader for the [Manufacturing Automation and Controls Group](https://www.ornl.gov/group/manufacturing-automation-and-controls) in the [Manufacturing Sciences Division](https://www.ornl.gov/division/manufacturing-science) at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://ornl.gov). I was an Associate Professor in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://mche.louisiana.edu) at [University of Louisiana at Lafayette](https://louisiana.edu) until May 2021, where I led the [C.R.A.W.LAB](https://userweb.ucs.louisiana.edu/~jev9637/). I'm still a Graduate Faculty member there.
